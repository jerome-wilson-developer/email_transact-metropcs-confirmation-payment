## metroPCS - PAYMENT CONFIRMATION 
Many customers want a confirmation email to verify their payment transactional was completed. This clone of a transactional email provides the payment amount, the date and time of the payment, and the balance due that remains. metroPCS is also boldly using a bright purple banner box to thank their customer for the payment. The footer contains miscellaneous information and "fine-print" regarding the account that may be of interest to their customers. 

## TECHNOLOGIES USED:
html tables, html5, css3, mobile responsive, npm, webpack, web accessibility, NVDA, GITHUB , lighthouse audit, NETLIFY.

## ACCESSIBILITY:
I used accessibility code to increase this page's web accessibility. I mostly used aria-role landmarks and tabindex code to increase focus and access. There is a strong movement in the web development world to build and code web content that is accessible to everybody. Lawsuits and accessility standards are happenning regularly. Some statistics report there are over 1 billion people worldwide who have difficulties using web content because of different disabilities.
