# email_transactional-metropcs-confirmation-payment

This confirmation for a monthly payment is being sent to a service subscriber of metroPCS. This clone of a transactional email provides the payment amount, the date and time of the payment, and the balance due that remains on this phone service account. metroPCS is also boldly using a bright purple banner box to thank their customer for the payment. The footer contains miscellaneous information and "fine-print" regarding the account that may be of interest to their customers.
